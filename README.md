#Graphs

##Maker Square assignment

Original spec: Create a graph (using a city/road metaphor) and use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between cities.

##TO DO
  - Implement a true priority queue
    - Current implementation of Dijkstra's algo uses an array as the 'priority queue'.
